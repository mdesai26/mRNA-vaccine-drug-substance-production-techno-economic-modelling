# mRNA-vaccine-drug-substance-production-techno-economic-modelling
Modelling files for the project “**Techno-economic Modelling of Continuous mRNA Vaccine Manufacturing, studying Influenza virus as case study**", conducted at the University of Sheffield (2024). The study utilizes SuperPro Designer and Excel to simulate, evaluate, and analyze the production process of mRNA vaccine drug substances with a focus on continuous manufacturing strategies.

This repository contains the following SuperPro and Excel files:

the SuperPro Designer Version 13, Build 3 Special 1000 (Intelligen, Inc.) model of RNA vaccine drug substance production process using mod-UTP (modified uridine-5'-triphosphate) ("Modified Batch model");
the economic evaluation report generated by SuperPro Designer ("Modified Batch model_EER.LL"), detailing capital and operational cost estimates;
the Excel file were the assumptions, techno-economic calculations and results are shown ("mRNA_vaccine_DS_batch_production_TEA_modelling_assumption&results.xlsx");
the "mRNA-InputOutputData.xlsx", input and output data in MS Excel generated by the global sensitivity analysis for mRNA and saRNA vaccine platforms.
This repository contains the following MatLab code files:

the "SuperPro.m" and "user_defined.m" files which are used to create a connection between SuperPro Designer (via Visual Basic for Applications in MS Excel) and SobolGSA (see details below about this software).
This repository contains the following SolbolGSA file:

• the "ProblemSetup - mRNA.psobol" file for setting up the problem and defining the inputs in the SobolGSA software.
