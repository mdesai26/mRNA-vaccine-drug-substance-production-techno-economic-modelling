# mRNA-vaccine-drug-substance-production-techno-economic-modelling
Modelling files for the project â€œ**Techno-economic Modelling of Continuous mRNA Vaccine Manufacturing, studying Influenza virus as case study**", conducted at the University of Sheffield (2024). The study utilizes SuperPro Designer and Excel to simulate, evaluate, and analyze the production process of mRNA vaccine drug substances with a focus on continuous manufacturing strategies.

This repository contains the following files:

the SuperPro Designer Version 13, Build 3 Special 1000 (Intelligen, Inc.) model of RNA vaccine drug substance production process ("Modified Batch model.spf");
the economic evaluation report generated by SuperPro Designer ("Modified Batch model_EER.LL"), detailing capital and operational cost estimates;
the Excel file were the assumptions, techno-economic calculations and results are shown ("/mRNA_vaccine_DS_batch_production_TEA_modelling_assumption&results.xlsx").
